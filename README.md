# fx.css

> A complete set of CSS animation (FX, aka Special Effect`) utility for web UI.

`FX.css` is a library where you can play with a collection of pre-made css animations.

`FX.css` started out as a small side-project of mine. As I was increasingly using CSS animations, I thought it would come in handy to have them organised in a meaningful and accessible way so that they can be easily reused on different projects.

I have been using `FX.css` for a while now and I hope some of you will find it useful as well. It is still very much a work in progress and hopefully it will evolve over the time :)

## _setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# build for production
$ npm run build
```
